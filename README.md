# background

Steam has attracted countless players around the world since its inception, but now, such an old platform is facing thousands of user victims who have been invaded by unknown means while using their accounts normally, and illegal transactions have led to the loss of countless loyal users' belongings. However, Steam persists. Claiming that there is no problem with their security system is the user's own problem. It's too bad, this kind of irresponsible platform, why should we let him get away with it like this? This is simply a cradle platform for criminals. Especially in the Asia-Pacific region, this kind of account theft is rampant, Steam ignores it, and the nonsense literature is simply inhumane.

Please raise your little hands and let us defeat this irresponsible behavior of Steam in this position.
